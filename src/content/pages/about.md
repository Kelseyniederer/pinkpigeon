The pink pigeon (*Nesoenas mayeri*) is a species of pigeon in the family [Columbidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae) [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)) to [Mauritius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius). The pink pigeon nearly became extinct in the 1970s and the 1990s and is still very rare. It is the only [Mascarene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascarene) pigeon that has not become extinct.[\[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_pigeon#cite_note-2)[\[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_pigeon#cite_note-3) It was on the brink of extinction in 1991 when only 10 individuals remained, but its numbers have increased due to the efforts of the [Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrell_Wildlife_Conservation_Trust) since 1977. While the population remains at below 500 birds as of 2011, the [IUCN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN) downlisted the species from [Critically endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_endangered) to [Endangered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) on the [IUCN Red List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List) in 2000, and then downlisted it again to [Vulnerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species) in 2018.
